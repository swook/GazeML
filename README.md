# GazeML
A deep learning framework based on Tensorflow for the training of high performance gaze estimation.

*Please note that though this framework may work on various platforms, it has only been tested on an Ubuntu 16.04 system.*

*All implementations are re-implementations of published algorithms and thus provided models should not be considered as reference.*

This is a fork from [swook/GazeML](https://github.com/swook/GazeML). I am on fixing some issues in importing the model to `.onnx` format and further to TensorRT `.engine` format.

I have tested this on:
- Ubuntu 20.04
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU
- Nvidia driver 510.54
- CUDA 11.6
- python 3.6
- tensorflow 1.14

This framework currently integrates the following models:

## ELG

## DPG

Deep Pictorial Gaze Estimation

*To download the MPIIGaze training data, please run `bash get_mpiigaze_hdf.bash`*

*Note: This reimplementation differs from the original proposed implementation and reaches 4.63 degrees in the within-MPIIGaze setting. The changes were made to attain comparable performance and results in a leaner model.*

## Installing dependencies

Follow [these instructions](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/install-python-linux) to download Python 3.7

Use python virtual environment ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)) to install python dependencies:

Run the following inside `GazeML` repository root folder:
```
python3.7 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install cython
pip install scipy
python3 setup.py install
pip install tensorflow==1.14
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14
```

## Getting pre-trained weights
To acquire the pre-trained weights provided with this repository, please run:
```
    bash get_trained_weights.bash
```

## Running the demo
To run the webcam demo, perform the following:
```
    cd src
    python3 elg_demo.py
```

To see available options, please run `python3 elg_demo.py --help` instead.
